                <p>Can move 1 or 2 squares in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). If it moves 2 squares and there's an enemy piece in the middle, it captures both pieces.</p>

                <h4>Archer</h4>
                <p>Moves like a pawn but can capture diagonally without moving. Either moves without capturing, or captures without moving.</p>

    <h2>Board Layout</h2>
    <p>The game is played on a 10x10 board with the following setup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wraths (Dragons) are positioned in the corners</li>
        <li>Archers are positioned in front of the King and Queen</li>
        <li>All other pieces follow standard chess positioning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Captures & Scoring</h2>
    <p>Captured pieces are sent to your graveyard. On desktops the graveyards flank the board, while on smaller screens they slide beneath it. Each capture also adds to your score using the following values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pawn – 1 point</li>
        <li>Archer – 3 points</li>
        <li>Knight / Bishop – 3 points</li>
        <li>Rook – 5 points</li>
        <li>Dragon – 7 points</li>
        <li>Queen – 9 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The live scoreboard at the top of the board tracks the totals for both sides so you can see who is ahead.</p>
