## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
*   MySQL Database
*   Node.js (v14 or higher recommended) and npm

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/billpottle/cloud-chess.git
    cd cloud-chess
    ```
2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Create a MySQL database for the application.
    *   Configure your database credentials in `api/db_connect.php`.
    *   Required tables (like `users`, `user_tokens`, `games`, etc.) should be created. Some scripts (e.g., `api/auth_token.php`) might attempt to create tables if they don't exist, but review `queries.sql` or manually create the schema for reliability.
3.  **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

Note: This is an early 2025 'vibe coding' attempt using several different models. 

There isn't a back end (just database) to validate moves, so it's possible to send invalid game 
states as your move. If you care that much about winning Cloud Chess - I'd certainly like to meet 
you!

1.  Ensure your web server is configured to serve PHP files from the project directory.
2.  Access the application through your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/cloud-chess/` or your configured virtual host).


1.  **Update Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js v14 or higher installed (`node --version`). Optional chaining (`?.`) used by Jest requires it.
2.  **Configure Test Script:** Make sure the `test` script in `package.json` is set to `"jest"`:
    ```json
      "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
      },
    ```
3.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

Board is 10x10 instead of 8x8
New piece - Archer - moves and kills like a pawn, but moves without killing and kills without moving
New piece - Wrath (dragon) - Moves like a queen, but only 2 spaces. If opponents are lined up, can kill both pieces in 1 move.
