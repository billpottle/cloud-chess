Web based cloud chess game


Implementation for the Cloud Chess game from Katie Pottle's Cloud Shifters novels. 

Board is 10x10 instead of 8x8
New piece - Archer - moves and kills like a pawn, but moves without killing and kills without moving
New piece - Wrath (dragon) - Moves like a queen, but only 2 spaces. If opponents are lined up, can kill both pieces in 1 move.
